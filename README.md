# SVM-for-Classification-and-Regression

## INTRO
Support Vector Machine is a supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is based on finding the hyperplane that best separates data into different classes (for classification). For regression tasks, SVM predicts a continuous value while minimizing error using a margin of tolerance.

## SVM for Classification
### Linear SVM
Works when the data is linearly separable (i.e., classes can be separated with a straight line). 
The objective is to maximize the margin while minimizing classification errors. 

### Non-Linear SVM
When data is not linearly separable, SVM uses kernels to transform the data into higher dimensions where a linear hyperplane can separate it

## SVM for Regression (SVR)
Instead of finding a hyperplane that separates classes, SVR finds a line or curve that fits the data within a certain margin of tolerance (Ïµ).
